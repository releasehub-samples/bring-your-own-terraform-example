# Release Application Template & Environment Variables

This directory contains Release example Application Template & Environment Variable configuration files. 

**Note** - If you have not enabled Release's GitOps feature for your account, these files must be copy-pasted into your Release application's default settings.

If you **do** have Release GitOps enabled, you can use these files directly by adding `.release.yaml` to the root of this repository. Refer to Release documentation for detail.
